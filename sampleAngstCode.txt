hear me out..

ugh this is a comment
ugh "lets make a string"

do what you want with number x should be 5 i guess
maybe x should be jack all{
    buncha 420 + 8;
}
or not. throws shade;

number z should be 7 i guess

number y should be anxious
"feeling angsty"
or whatever

bool myBool should be cool

thats deep.

could be 7
should be 8
x = 7
